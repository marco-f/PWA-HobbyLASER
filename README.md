A **Progressive Web App (PWA)** designed for the **HobbyLaser** project. This web-based application enables users to draw, process images, and communicate with a laser or CNC machine through an browser-based interface.  
> **Optimized for Google Chrome in Dark Mode** 
> 
> **Important:** This application uses the **Web Serial API** to communicate with the laser/CNC controller.  
> Only **Google Chrome** and other Chromium-based browsers (like Microsoft Edge) currently support this feature.

## Features

- **Interactive Drawing**: Users can draw directly within the web interface.
- **Custom Font Support**: The app allows the usage of custom fonts for enhanced design flexibility.
- **Offline Capabilities**: Thanks to **Service Workers**, the app can function without an internet connection, offering offline access to previously loaded content.
- **Installation as a PWA**: Users can install the app on their device (Android/iOS/PC) for a native app experience, with full offline support.
- **Save Progress**: Your work can be saved locally, ensuring that you don't lose any data.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the basic structure and markup of the app.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and layout, including responsive design for mobile devices.
- **JavaScript**: Handles interactive elements and logic for the drawing interface.
- **Service Workers**: Enable offline capabilities by caching assets and data.
- **Web Manifest**: Configures the appâ€™s metadata (app icon, theme color, etc.) for PWA installation.

- **Interactive Drawing**: Draw vector shapes directly in the browser.
- **Custom Font Support**: Use your own fonts for creative flexibility.
- **SVG Creation & Editing**: Import, transform, and generate scalable vector graphics (SVG).
- **Raster Image Handling**: Load and process raster images (e.g., PNG, JPG) for laser engraving.
- **G-code Generation**: Convert designs to G-code and send to a microcontroller.
- **PWA Installation**: Installable as a standalone app on Android, iOS, or desktop.
- **Dark Mode Ready**: Optimized for **Chrome's dark theme** for reduced eye strain and professional look.
